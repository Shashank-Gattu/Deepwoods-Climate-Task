Project Overview: Green Positive is an interactive web application designed to promote environmental sustainability by allowing users to calculate their CO₂ savings from commuting via electric vehicles (EVs). The platform encourages users to participate in the Green Positive campaign, share their impact on social media, and submit feedback to help improve the platform's features.
Features:

CO₂ Savings Calculator: Users can enter the distance traveled in kilometers to calculate the CO₂ saved by using an electric vehicle instead of a petrol vehicle. The savings are displayed in real-time, promoting awareness of the environmental benefits of switching to EVs.

Feedback Form: After calculating their CO₂ savings, users are prompted to share their feedback on the platform. This includes a short survey on whether they would choose an EV again and their other sustainable habits. The feedback helps the Green Positive team gather insights on user preferences and enhance the platform’s features.

Social Media Sharing: Users can easily share their CO₂ savings on social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Twitter with just a click of a button. This feature encourages users to spread the message of sustainability, inspiring others to take part in the Green Positive movement.

Campaign Tab: The "Campaign" section highlights Green Positive's focus on air pollution, public health awareness, and supporting vulnerable transport workers. It also provides users with the option to download a brochure to learn more about the campaign and how they can get involved.

Contact Us Form: The "Contact Us" section allows users to directly communicate with the Green Positive team. Users can submit inquiries, suggestions, or requests for additional information.
